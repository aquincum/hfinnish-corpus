Hanalyze library and tools
==========================

# What is this?

Hanalyze as well as the tools in the main directory are Haskell programs for corpus analysis. The main goal is to get some analysis done, and for me to learn Haskell!

# What do the executables do?

## create_fds

`create_fds' opens a raw corpus file and converts it to a simple frequency distribution

## merge_fds

`merge_fds', rather unsurprisingly, merges frequency distributions

## filter_fds

`filter_fds' filters a frequency distribution based on properties of word that are of interest, and saves the filtered version.

## hanalyze1

`hanalyze1' will run some summary for the data.
